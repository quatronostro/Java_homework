I try to create basic calculator program with Java.

You can find codes under the "src" file. I created basic calculator in Java. In this calculator, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be done with only two variables. I tried to translate my latest <a href="https://github.com/quatronostro/basic_calculator_withPython">basic calculator program in Python</a>. I hope you like it :)
